# Curve-Fit Algorithm
During the internship project at Veracity Trust Network, a team of Mathematics graduates collaborated under the leadership of a dedicated project lead to develop a curve-fitting model that improved the precision of malicious bot detection on client websites by approximately 5%. The project involved intensive research and algorithmic development to overcome the challenges posed by a limited bot-behavior dataset and the need to scale detection to large real-time data. By combining qualitative insights with quantitative techniques, the team adapted linear regression to meet the curve-fitting requirements, ensuring robustness despite initial setbacks with traditional regression methods. Delivered within a tight two-week deadline, the project demonstrated effective teamwork and innovative problem-solving, providing the company with valuable outcomes and a foundation for future advancements.
